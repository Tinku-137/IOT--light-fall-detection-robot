Component List
Here’s a list of components commonly used in LDR-based projects:

Arduino Uno (or any compatible microcontroller)

LDR (Light Dependent Resistor) - For light sensing

Resistors (10kΩ) - For LDR voltage divider

LEDs - For indication or output

Servo Motor (optional) - For solar tracking or directional control

Breadboard and Jumper Wires - For connections

Power Supply (USB or battery)
